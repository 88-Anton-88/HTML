    <h2>ACT 1</h2>
    <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
   <code><p>
Two households, both alike in dignity 
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life; 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked 
love And the continuance of their parents’ rage, 
Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend, 
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

    <h2>SCENE 1. Verona. A public place</h2>
    <p><i>Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers,
        of the house of Capulet.</i></p>
        <h2>SAMPSON</h2>
        <p>Gregory, on my word we’ll not carry coals.</p>
        <h2>GREGORY</h2>
        <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
